    <p class="abouttext">A health insurance claim is a request that a health insurance policyholder submits to the
        Insurance Company in order to obtain the services that are covered in their health insurance policy. A health
        insurance
        policyholder
        can either get reimbursed or can opt for direct claim settlement option (also known as cashless treatment) for
        the
        availed medical services. In this way, one can either submit the claim form or request the health insurance
        provider cashless services.

        <p class="abouttext">Providing healthcare service when needed is the true utility of a health insurance plan.
            To
            ensure timely and easy settlement of all the
            medical expenses, one needs to initiate the health insurance claim process. There are two ways to claim a
            health
            insurance policy:</p>
        <div class="howtoGet">
            
            <h4>Cashless Claims :</h4>
            <p>In this type of health insurance claim, the insurer settles all the hospitalization bills with the
                hospital
                directly. However, an insured needs to be hospitalized only at a network hospital to get the benefit of
                cashless hospitalization.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="howtoGet">
            <h4>Reimbursement Claims :</h4>
            <p>In this type of claim process, the policyholder pays for the hospitalization expenses upfront and
                requests
                for reimbursement by the insurance provider later. One can get reimbursement facility at both network
                and
                non-network hospitals in this case.</p>

                    by
                    the hospital (network) about the same, the insurer verifies the validity of the policy and policy
                    coverage
                    of that policyholder. Then, a field doctor is assigned to facilitate the request for the
                    pre-authorization
                    document and to cross-check the claimed treatment. After verification, the medical team from the
                    insurance
                    company approves the cashless claim for the policyholder according to the terms and conditions of
